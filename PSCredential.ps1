# Purpose:	These functions allow one to easily save network credentials to disk in a relatively
#			secure manner.  The resulting on-disk credential file can only [1] be decrypted
#			by the same user account which performed the encryption.  For more details, see
#			the help files for ConvertFrom-SecureString and ConvertTo-SecureString as well as
#			MSDN pages about Windows Data Protection API.
#			[1]: So far as I know today.  Next week I'm sure a script kiddie will break it.
#
# Usage:	Export-PSCredential [-Credential <PSCredential object>] [-Path <file to export>]
#
#			If Credential is not specififed, user is prompted by Get-Credential cmdlet.
#			If not specififed, Path is "./credentials.enc.xml".
#			Output: FileInfo object referring to saved credentials
#
#			Import-PSCredential [-Path <file to import>]
#
#			If not specififed, Path is "./credentials.enc.xml".
#			Output: PSCredential object
